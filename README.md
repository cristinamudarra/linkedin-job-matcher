# [WORK IN PROGRESS!]
# Job Search Skills Analysis Project

This Python-based project aims to analyze thousands of job listings to identify the most in-demand skills for roles such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst. The project workflow involves several key stages:

## 1. Web Scraping from LinkedIn
The project initiates by performing web scraping on LinkedIn to gather a comprehensive dataset of job listings.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Following data collection, an exploratory analysis of the dataset is conducted. This step involves examining and understanding the structure, patterns, and characteristics of the job listings.

## 3. Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms
Different types of unsupervised machine learning algorithms are implemented to extract insights from the dataset. The primary objective is to cluster and visualize groups of demanded skills based on various factors such as location, company size, or industry.

Implemented Algorithms:
- Clustering Techniques: Utilizing algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering.
- Visualization of Skill Groups: Visual representations to showcase clusters of in-demand skills based on specific job attributes.

## Project Goals:
- Skill Identification: Identify the most sought-after skills for specific data-related roles.
- Insights Generation: Generate insights regarding skill preferences based on location, company size, and industry.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: Enable data-driven decision-making for job seekers and employers by understanding skill demand trends.
  
## How to Use:
- Requirements: Ensure Python environment with necessary libraries (provide details of required libraries and versions).
- Instructions: Step-by-step guide on running the code, initiating scraping, performing analysis, and interpreting results.
  
## Future Enhancements:
- Refinement of analysis techniques for more granular skill identification.
- Interactive visualizations for better data exploration.
- Incorporation of additional job search platforms for a more comprehensive dataset.
