Sign in Report this job Description As a Data Analyst or Data Scientist at Actica, you will have the opportunity to use and develop your data skills to unlock business problems for a wide range of high-profile UK public sector organisations. Your help will enable them to get the maximum benefit from their investments in technology, information and facilities, and in doing so, play a key role in nationally critical projects which make a real difference to people’s everyday lives. Actica recognises that Data Analytics and Data Science are different disciplines, though closely related. When we talk about Data Analytics, we think primarily of exploiting existing data to generate deeper insights and support faster, more assured decision-taking. When we talk about Data Science, our focus is on scoping, designing, and developing innovative ways to capture and exploit new or previously unexploited data. Actica colleagues tend to move between the two, depending on experience, interest, and client requirements. In either role, you would be expected to translate business problems into data queries, applying data standards and principles to add fresh understanding. You should be able to provide advice on how best to set up data exploitation to assure success, including consideration of a range of different languages and toolsets. You will need to relate your work to the clients’ wider data environment, so understanding of some of the key principles of data architecture is also important. This role will require you to work flexibly as part of teams of varying sizes and compositions – including data specialists and others with different skillsets. Over time, you may move on to leading assignments and take responsibility for supervising direct reports whilst ensuring the overall success of the engagement. Actica Consulting is a growing Technology Consultancy that works on some of the most nationally critical technology projects. We specialise in delivering complex projects to limited timescales. Our customers include a wide range of public sector organisations; such as, the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence, HM Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, Police Forces, Fire Services and the NHS; as well as a range of national and international companies across the private sector. We are recruiting in order to facilitate continued growth of the business and as a result multiple positions are available across Consultant, Senior Consultant, and Principal Consultant grades. The advertised role is for employment on a permanent basis; however, we are happy to discuss Associate (contract) opportunities if that is your preference. Collaborate with application teams to assess existing on-premises or legacy applications and plan their migration to the cloud. Have a high-level knowledge of security and compliance requirements throughout the design process. Then implement appropriate security controls, such as identity and access management, encryption, and network security, to protect data and resources. Optimize existing cloud-based systems for performance and scalability, understanding bottlenecks and then implement solutions such as caching mechanisms, load balancing, and auto-scaling capabilities efficiently. Collaboration with cross-functional teams, including developers, operations personnel, department stakeholders. Candidates must be eligible and willing to gain high level UK Security Clearance to apply for this position. Key Responsibilities Working either individually or – more usually - as part of a larger team, you will undertake assignments such as: Creating genuinely useful data outcomes to help deliver client goals in major business transformation programmes; Hands-on analytics, including working with clients, users and other team members to address data availability and quality issues before they become blockers; Carrying out ‘pre-discovery’ to establish which business problems, or which parts of business problems, are best addressed through data analytics / data science; Translating business problems into data exploitation queries; Specifying data analytics and data science environments; Understanding data flows, i.e., which parts of the organization generate data, which require data to function, how data flows are managed, and how data changes in transition; Collaborating and coordinating with multiple departments, stakeholders, partners, and external vendors. Skills, Knowledge and Expertise We work predominantly within the UK Defence and Public Sectors so experience within those sectors is desirable, preferably in roles which have used data to solve business problems. The fast-moving nature of the Public Sector technology environment, together with the need to resource multiple, ad-hoc assignments, also requires our data analysts and data scientists to be quick thinkers, proactive and self-motivated – with the ability to apply a structured approach to often unfamiliar subject matter. The following attributes and areas of experience will make you particularly suited to this role with Actica: Coding eg expertise in Python or R; Collaborative, team-based development; Cloud analytics platforms eg relevant AWS and Azure platform services; Data visualisation tools eg Power BI, Qlik Sense; Data science approaches and tooling eg Hadoop, Spark; Data engineering approaches; Database management, eg MySQL, Postgress; Government Digital Service approaches, ie the Government Service Design Manual and the Service Standard; Software development methods and techniques eg Agile methods such as SCRUM; Software change management, notably familiarity with git; Public sector best practice guidance, eg ITIL, OGC toolkit. You will also need to hold or be eligible to hold UK security clearance; more information about the clearances can be found here: United Kingdom Security Vetting: clearance levels - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) Benefits 25 days of paid leave per annum plus 8 UK bank holidays Participation in a discretionary bonus scheme Participation in our stakeholder pension scheme Participation in cycle to work scheme Employee Assistance Programme Electric Car leasing Scheme Actica Consulting is a technical and management consultancy dedicated to ensuring that its customers make best use of emerging Information and Communications technologies in achieving their business objectives.

If you are an experienced data scientist who is keen on a role that balances technical code development and supporting data science development in others then we look forward to hearing from you Skills And Experience We would love to hear from your if you can demonstrate experience against the following criteria, which will be assessed in your personal statement: Developing data science capability: You can support others to develop their data science capability and apply data science skills in their own work [Note that we will assess this lead criterion at sift stage via a separate technical competency, so you do not need to also cover this criterion in your personal statement] Programming: You have strong expertise in processing data using either Python or R, and are keen to use both Python and SQL as part of this role. Data engineering: You have experience using Git for code collaboration and are able to support others with basic Git usage. You are confident using data science tools commonly used for RAP, such as SQL databases, IDEs, package managers, common Python/R libraries, dashboards or reproducible reporting. (This list is illustrative, not exhaustive, and experience in every one of these is not required) Data science innovation: You demonstrate broad knowledge of data science tools and techniques, which you have creatively deployed to solve analytical or business problems. Business delivery: You can design and manage processes to gather and establish user needs, and deliver technical solutions that deliver the best user solution given the available resource and time constraints. Communication: You can effectively communicate technical data science concepts (such as Git branching or package management) to less experienced colleagues. You can effectively listen to colleagues who are sharing details of technical issues, and involve relevant teams and managers as appropriate.
